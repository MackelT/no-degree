# no-degree
I am creating a web presence that will allow people to learn in ways that a university can not provide.
I was one of those kids that was very smart but that did not do well in the public shcool system. I beleive that learning is a very individual thing and that it is most productive when it is motivated by desire and not punishment or reward. The best way to learn is to ask a question and then receive an answer. The human brain is incredible at learning what it needs and not so good at learning what it doesn't. What if there was a platform that instead of just shoveling information down your throat, it understood who you were and where you were trying to get, and then first helped you understand why you needed to know something before it tried to teach you. Could big data play a part in teaching a system what types of things to show. Could you harness the already large media stores on youtube to help educate people and allow an open source university to emerge?
